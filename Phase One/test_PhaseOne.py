# Main program for Phase 1
# Additionally, write a test program for the class Graph test_graph.py using as a base the program
# given below. Look at the function that generates the graph (crearGrafoEjemplo), it adds the nodes
# with their names and coordinates, then it adds the segments that connect the nodes. Extend to test
# the error conditions.
